description: "
<p>Being involved in IT-Security implies having some programming skills. During my studies I was working as Java-Developer for 4 years. Having gathered some experience there I found myself favouring python. Over time I studied some machine-learning and NLP algorithms. During my Master Thesis I wrote a Flutter application to consume streams of Twitter posts and run it through an NLP-Pipline with the goal to identify crisis events.</p>
<p>Further you will find a list of projects of mine, outside of the IT-Security context.</p>
