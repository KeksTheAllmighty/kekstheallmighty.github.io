description: "
<p>During my studies at TU-Darmstadt I was fascinated by the IT-Security field and practiced a lot of attack techniques at local events, USD hacker-days, CTFs and VulnHub machines. I also was able to find a vulnerability on University machines which I, of course, reported immediately.</p>
<p>After finishing the university I ended up at an SOC in a finance background. In addition to my job I am continuing my education by taking on Security certifications. Further You will see the list of accomplished studies.</p>
